# Unity - ARWorldMap Save Load Tags
This demo shows an example for saving and loading Unity Game Objects in ARKit. The contents are created in AR and later restored in their corresponding positions.

- Try using Unity version 2018.3.1.f1 as ARKit is updated regularly and might not be compatible with other versions.

- For convenience I have included the UnityARKitPlugin inside the project. 

- Open Scene:  ‘UnityARWorldMapWithTags’; Build and deploy to your iOS device or simulator.

- Make sure to add your Signing Team ID under PlayerSettings -> Other Settings before Building for iOS Device.
