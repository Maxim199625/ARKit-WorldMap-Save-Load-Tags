Try using Unity version 2018.3.1.f1 as ARKit is updated regularly and might no be compatibale with other versions.
For convenience I have included the UnityARKitPlugin inside the project. 
Open Scene:  ‘UnityARWorldMapWithTags’; Build and deploy to your iOS device or simulator.
Make sure to add your Signing Team ID under PlayerSettings -> Other Settings before Building for iOS Device.
